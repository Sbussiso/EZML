# EZML
EZML is a machine learning application that uses the gpt-3 api to generate testing/training data and export to csv and excel. With this application you can generate large amounts of data in an instant to train your machine learning models taking a lot of time and work out of supervised learning.

# Prompt Example:

Bot: Hello! what kind of data would you like to generate?

User: I need data for training a sentiment analysis machine learning algorithm. its purpose is to determin wether a sentance is positive or negative.

Bot:
 Sure! I can generate a large amount of training data for your sentiment analysis machine learning algorithm. Here's an example of how the data will be formatted in a CSV file:

sentiment,sentence

positive,"I absolutely loved the movie!"

negative,"The food at the restaurant was terrible."

positive,"The concert was amazing, I had a great time."

negative,"I was really disappointed with the service at the hotel."

positive,"The book was so inspiring, I couldn't put it down."

negative,"The customer support was unhelpful and rude."

positive,"The vacation was perfect, everything went smoothly."

negative,"The traffic was unbearable, it ruined my day."

positive,"The product exceeded my expectations, I'm very satisfied."

negative,"The quality of the product was poor, it broke after a few uses."

Please let me know how many rows of data you would like me to generate, and I'll create the CSV file for you.
NOTE: at any time type 'export to excel' to export the current data to an Excel sheet
